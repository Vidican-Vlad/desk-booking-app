# desk-booking-app
This was a project developed in under 48 Hours  for an  Hackaton (ITEC https://itec.ro/page/itec-2022)

the thema  was developing an desk booking web app for Hybrid workplace offices

there were two types of desks: assigned(permanent) or hot desks (bookable

administrators could create new offices, floors, and desks

when creating a floor the admin would provide an image with the blueprint of the floor and a json file defining the location of each desk on that floor

users who were not assigned to a permanent desk were able to book desks both for the day or in advance

administrators could swap the type of a desk at any time, in case a hot desk became assigned  all scheduled bookings were cancelled for that desk

the tech stack we used for this project was MERN

My team (team of three) has won the second place of the advanced web development section of the hackaton

I was responsible of the back end while the two other colleagues were working on the front end
